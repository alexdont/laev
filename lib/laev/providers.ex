  Multi-debrid orchestration: one resolve/probe interface over every
  configured provider (Real-Debrid first — deepest cache — then TorBox).

  A source is playable if ANY provider can serve it. The interplay with the
  DMCA blocklist matters: an RD 451 no longer buries a source — TorBox gets
  a shot first, and hashes already on the blocklist (including ones recorded
  before TorBox existed) are still probed on TorBox, RD skipped. A hash is
  only blocklisted when no configured provider can play it.
